# Monkeys_VS_Shakespeare

## Description

This is the source code of a stupid MMO idea of players being monkeys on typewriters fighting battles, in the from of typing out books. Potentially the final project for the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp; and showcase of everything that has been learned in the class so far. If there are additional members to this project they will be listed down below:

## Road Map

System Wide

1. First things first is to get the typing game portion of the game up and functional. I will be doing research into how to put this together. It is important that we pull from API's that can provide book snippets 

2. Implement a way for users to 'login' and create a character.

Game Mechanic

1. Create classes for that player to choose that will have different typing styles and roles within the game's combat and ecosystem.

2. Player Gardens; This is a zone that is attached to a player where they can make a typing challenge for other players to do. They can be rated by other players. When a user first starts they can only make paragraphs for others to type, but after they gain levels they will be able to type out much longer prompts for other players. The hope is that players will make whole stories for others to type out.
