## Road Map

System Wide

1. First things first is to get the typing game portion of the game up and functional.

2. Implement a way for users to 'login' and create a character.

3. Get chat rooms up and going.

Game Mechanic

1. Create classes for players to choose that will have different typing styles and roles within the game's combat and ecosystem.

Fall off Goals (Post Project)

1. Player Gardens; This is a zone that is attached to a player where they can make a typing challenge for other players to do. They can be rated by other players. When a user first starts they can only make paragraphs for others to type, but after they gain levels they will be able to type out much longer prompts for other players. The hope is that players will make whole stories for others to type out.
