		"name": "Macbeth",
		"description": "In Macbeth, the murder of a king by one of his subjects is seen as unnatural and the images of the play reflect this theme, with disruptions of nature, like storms and events such as where the horses turn on their grooms and bite them. In Macbeth Shakespeare explores what it is to be a man. Lady Macbeth accuses Macbeth of being unmanly because of his hesitation in killing Duncan, but Macbeth says that itâ€™s unmanly for a man to kill his king. Shakespeare plays with that paradox. Duncan is a good king and a good man, and he is surrounded by images of light. Macbeth and Lady Macbeth turn their surroundings into a picture of hell, blanketed in darkness. Those images of light and dark interact throughout the play.",
